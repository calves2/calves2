**Catherine (Catie) Alves, Ph.D.**  
*Pronouns: she/her/hers*  
I am a marine ecologist and conservation social scientist contracted to:   
* [Social Sciences Branch](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact-directory/social-sciences-branch)  
* [Northeast Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northeast-fisheries-science-center)  
* [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)  

My research interests focus on social-ecological systems, coral reef ecology, sustainable fisheries management, and stakeholder engagement. I have worked in Mexico, Belize, and the Northeast United States to combine social science with ecology to inform improved management of marine ecosystems. I value connecting academics,  resource managers, and communities to achieve shared conservation objectives.   

My current work is part of a 3-year interdisciplinary project [assessing the vulnerability of the Atlantic Sea Scallop social-ecological system in the Northeast US to changing ocean conditions.](http://www.cfrfoundation.org/atlantic-sea-scallop-socialecological-system) I am collaborating with oceanographers, scallop biologists, social scientists and industry partners. We seek to understand how changing ocean conditions (namely, ocean warming and acidification) affect the Atlantic sea scallop fishery, and how the fishing industry and communities can potentially adapt to those changes. We are interested in projecting the vulnerability of the sea scallop populations, and how that will affect the industry and communities dependent on them.
